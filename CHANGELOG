Change Log
----------
v1.7 (08/15/2022): modified by - Jason Leaver
1. added development container with cartopy
2. TODO: remove basemap requirement
3. TODO: package code in subdirs

v1.6 (05/23/2017):
1. Added capability to directly ingest grib-format mosaics via pygrib. This required
   extensive additions to mummy.MosaicGrib.
2. Added dependencies - datetime, pygrib (optional).
3. Minor code formatting and aesthetic updates.
4. Added a notebook to demo direct grib2 download and ingest, as well as display
   of data using cartopy.

v1.5.1 (08/10/2015):
1. Updated NetcdfFile class to be more Python 3 compatible.
2. Removed need for range function from six.moves.

v1.5 (07/30/2015):
1. Added Python 3.4 support. Python 2.7 is also supported.
2. Removed scipy dependency but added the six module as a dependency.
3. Updated the notebooks to also demo the data subsection and
   composite output capabilities. 

v1.4.3 Major changes (07/02/2015):
1. Minor fixes to remove some compiler warnings.

v1.4.2 major changes (04/25/2015):
1. Code now gives no errors against pep8 module.

v1.4.1 major changes (04/04/2015):
1. Replaced “==“ and “!=“ tests against None with “is” and “is not” to remove 
   FutureWarnings.
2. Added disabled read_mosaic_grib() method to MosaicStitch class.
3. Swapped numpy.ndim in for numpy.rank as the latter is deprecated.

v1.4 major changes (2/18/2015):
1. Shifted plotting routines to separate MosaicDisplay object.
   To use: display = mmmpy.MosaicDisplay(mosaic_tile_object)
   Then display will have plot_horiz(), plot_vert(), and three_panel_plot() methods.
2. Added read_mosaic_grib() method to MosaicTile, as well as supporting classes
   MosaicGrib and NetcdfFile to augment the new method. MMM-Py now can read 
   grib2-format MRMS mosaics by feeding MosaicTile a list of grib2 files (one for each
   horizontal slice) from the same volume. 
3. Despite the vastly modified new data format, the old MMM-Py common data model has been
   retained, and thus one can still read in a set of grib2s, subsection them, and write
   out to the old MRMS binary format.  
4. Moved Change Log to CHANGELOG file.

v1.3.2 major changes (8/27/2014):
1. Converted epochtime_to_string() to a public independent function.
2. Added compute_grid_attributes as a public independent function. This will
   return volumes and areas of 3-D and 2-D grid cells, respectively.

v1.3.1 major changes:
1. Added output_composite() method to MosaicTile to compute a 2D composite,
   set it as the only available '3D' field, and write to an MRMS binary file.
2. Added resolution and area_thresh keywords to plot_horiz() and 
   three_panel_plot() methods, to allow adjustment of these Basemap 
   characteristics.

v1.3 major changes
1. Added write_mosaic_binary() method to MosaicTile. Writes out MRMS-format
   binary file.
2. Added capability to read gzipped NetCDF files w/out first decompressing.
   Also now can read uncompressed binary files.
3. Added MosaicTile.Tile attribute, which stores the tile number as a string.
   Number determined based on MRMS Version and StartLat/Lon values.
   MosaicStitch. Tile attribute becomes a concatenated string of tile numbers
   upon stitching one or more MosaicTiles together.
4. Added linewidth keyword to plot_horiz() and three_panel_plot() methods.
   Can now add/thicken gridlines by setting to something other than default 0.
5. Added subsection() method to MosaicTile. It subsections a tile/stitch to a
   smaller grid.

v1.2.1 major changes
1. Added cross-section information to default plot titles.
2. Improved the performance of read_mosaic_binary(), ~3x speedup!

v1.2 major changes
1. Added read_mosaic_binary() method to MosaicTile class. This method reads in
   gzipped binary MRMS mosaics. It runs in pure Python so it takes a short while
   (~25 seconds on my Mac laptop) to read in a single v2 tile.
2. Removed the gridlines (but kept the numbers) from the Basemap plots, 
   if show_grid=True.

v1.1 major changes
1. Signficant refactoring of code to offload many tasks to internal methods of 
   MMM-Py, MosaicTile, and MosaicStitch. This simplified most public
   methods, reduced the number of local variables appearing in any one method,
   and reduced duplication in the code.
2. Added MosaicTile.three_panel_plot() method, which creates a multi-panel 
   plot that shows one horizontal and two vertical plot cross-sections.
3. Plotting methods now can return figure, axis, and Basemap objects if you set
   return_flag=True. This enables the creation of highly customized plots, 
   including overlays, but still using MMM-Py's plotting methods as a baseline.
4. Fixed a nasty bug where apparently v2 mosaics were not fully converting from
   scipy.io.netcdf objects into true ndarrays. This was killing the kernel when
   attempting to do something quantitative or visual with mrefl3d.

v1.0.2 major changes:
1. Changed names of Mosaic_Tile to MosaicTile and Mosaic_Stitch to
   MosaicStitch to conform with PEP8 class naming standards.

v1.0.1 major changes:
1. Added fix for v1/v2 mosaic changeover on 7/30/2013, so that 
   v1 mosaics read from NetCDF produced by MRMS_to_CFncdf will correctly 
   be identified as v1 mosaics.


Planned updates
---------------
1. Make grib2 reading quicker and more elegant.
